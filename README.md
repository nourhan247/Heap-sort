# Heap-sort
Max-Heap using an array, supporting insertion, deletion, and heap construction. The insert method adds a value and maintains the heap by bubbling it up, while delete removes the root and restores the heap by bubbling down. The buildup method builds the heap, and deleted root values are stored in a dynamically resized array.
